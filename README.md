# Deep Learning Project

## Project Description

The rapid advancements in robotics are ushering in a new era where robots are poised to seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, undertaking a myriad of tasks in diverse and dynamic environments. As robots transition from the confines of industrial settings to the bustling landscapes of our homes, streets, and workplaces, a fundamental question arises: How can we equip these robots with the adaptability and flexibility to navigate and thrive in such complex and ever-changing surroundings? How can we develop models that transcend specific applications, enabling robots to effortlessly transition between tasks without the need for extensive reconfiguration?

At the heart of this quest lies the concept of Scene Understanding a critical component in endowing robots with the cognitive ability to comprehend and respond to their environmental context. Scene Understanding, in the context of this project, entails the capacity to discern the nature of the environment in which an agent operates, based on visual inputs such as images or videos.

While robotics stands as a prominent application domain for Scene Understanding, our focus is to address the problem in a general way, by identifying various environments related to daily life, which could then be applied to other applications such as aiding blind people.

Scene Understanding, being a multifaceted problem, encompasses various sub-tasks including scene classification, object detection, scene retrieval, and more. In this project, our focus is directed towards the specific task of Scene Classification. Scene Classification involves associating an image of the environment with a label from a predefined set of categories, which seemed to us to be the task we were best equipped for.
